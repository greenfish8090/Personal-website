Hi! I'm Pranav Balaji, a final year Computer Science undergraduate at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad. I'm mainly interested in the field of Natural Language Processing and Sequence Processing in general.\
\
I've worked on many Deep Learning projects in the past as part of my internship, course-work and my own interest. Some of them include Sign Language Translation, Paraphrase Generation and Recommender systems among others. What started off as a simple exploration of the field, when I did the Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng, is slowly growing into my professional research interest. PyTorch is my framework of choice.\
\
I'm also interested in Computer Graphics with one of my favourite projects being Ray-tracing implemented in OpenGL. Looking forward to working on something that lies in the intersection of CG and ML.\
\
For fun, I love to do Origami, Speedcubing, and go Scuba diving - having recently gotten certified by PADI as an Advanced Open Water Diver. As of the past 3 years, I've also been learning Japanese and am fascinated by the culture. Definitely visiting there someday!
