Hi! I'm Pranav Balaji and I love building things.\
\
When I was little, it manifested as Origami, Lego and taking apart RC cars and helicopters only to assemble them back. As I grew older, I gravitated towards Computer Science and Engineering where I had seemingly limitless freedom on what I could do. I explored all the way from Arduino to Game dev to Web dev, but what stuck around was Machine Learning. I ended up doing my undergraduate thesis on it and co-founded a startup in the field.\
\
I've worked on many Deep Learning projects in the past as part of my education, work and my own interest - Talking head video generation, Video sign language translation, Continually trained transformer for paraphrase generation and an Anime recommender system are a few.\
\
My fascination with Computer Graphics started off with a university project where my friends and I built a Ray Tracing pipeline with OpenGL and C++. This slowly evolved into a love for Computer Vision and I've been working in it ever since.\
\
For fun, I (still) love to do Origami, Speedcube, keep minimally mobile pets and go Scuba diving - having the Advanced Open Water Diver certification. As of the past 5 years, I've also been learning Japanese intermittently and have a deep fascination with the language.
