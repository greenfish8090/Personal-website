Hi! I'm Pranav Balaji, a final year Computer Science undergraduate at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad. I'm interested in the field of Natural Language Processing, but I've recently also been exploring Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. This semester, I'm working with [Dr. Abhijit Das](https://sites.google.com/site/dasabhijit2048/home?authuser=0) on Deepfake detection and with [Dr Manik Gupta](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/manik/Profile) on Few shot learning for ECG arrhythmia detection. Informally, I'm also working with [Dr. Keisuke Sakaguchi](https://keisuke-sakaguchi.github.io) on a project involving RL and NLP. \
\
I've worked on many Deep Learning projects in the past as part of my internship, course-work and my own interest - Video Sign Language Translation, Paraphrase Generation and Recommender systems are a few. What started off as a simple exploration of the field, when I did the Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng, has slowly grown into my professional interest.\
\
I'm also interested in Computer Graphics with one of my favourite projects being Ray-tracing implemented in OpenGL. Looking forward to working on something that lies in the intersection of CG and ML.\
\
For fun, I love to do Origami, Speedcubing, and go Scuba diving - having recently gotten certified by PADI as an Advanced Open Water Diver. As of the past 3 years, I've also been learning Japanese and am fascinated by the culture. Definitely visiting there someday!
