Hi! I'm Pranav Balaji, an entrepreneur at Inria Startup Studio. This site is a work in progress :)\
\
I've worked on many Deep Learning projects in the past as part of my internship, course-work and my own interest - Video Sign Language Translation, Paraphrase Generation and Recommender systems are a few not mentioned above. What started off as a simple exploration of the field, when I did the Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng, has slowly grown into my professional interest.\
\
I'm also interested in Computer Graphics with one of my favourite projects being Ray-tracing implemented in OpenGL.\
\
For fun, I love to do Origami, Speedcubing, and go Scuba diving - having the Advanced Open Water Diver certification. As of the past 5 years, I've also been learning Japanese intermittently and have a deep fascination with the language.
